## 👋 &nbsp;Hi there! I'm Justin

### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

- 💡 &nbsp;I love learning to build and building to learn, especially if it means solving real-world problems. It's always great when you're able to solve that puzzle!
-  🎓 &nbsp;I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I've developed my programming knowledge by creating vairous web development applications and I supplemented that with Columbia University at New York's intensive software engineering bootcamp.
-  🌱 &nbsp;I'm currently learning software testing. Next on my list is Docker and solidifying my knowledge in data structures and algorithms.
- ✍️ &nbsp;In my free time, I love learning something new, cooking, or playing video games with my friends.
- 💬 &nbsp;Feel free to reach out to me for a coffee chat (virtual or otherwise)!
- 📄 &nbsp;Here's my [resume](https://justinramirez.vercel.app/cv) for more details about me. I'm open to feedback and suggestions!
